Keyboard Kit
Keyboard Kit is designed to be an educational tool for use with a piano connected to a desktop PC. It makes no musical tones.

Sight Reading Practice
When "Keep Score" activated, random notes will appear on the staff and a score is updated for correct notes selected on your piano.  There are far more simple phone apps to learn the notes so this will be removed.

Common Chord Finder
When "Key Search" is activated, pressing five or more keys on your piano will identify keys those notes belong to. Nice for finding keys while listening.
My favorite bit.

Common Chords For Keys
Selecting a Key using the button above the piano will identify the most common fourteen chords for that key.
My #2 favorite bit.

Break On Middle C
The staff will show which notes you're currently playing including the area where bass and treble keys overlap. "Break on Middle C" will split those.

Midi Enabled
The top header bar will signal that a midi device has been detected (or disconnected). Currently most major browsers support midi devices.

Scales
Selecting a Key using the button above the piano will identify the scale for that key with the starting note highlighted.

Show Line Names
When Show Line Names" is actived, it simply identifies the staff line names.

By the time I made this I already knew what it taught so never used actually used it but have ideas to make it useful.
